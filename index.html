            <img src="image-projet.jpg" alt="Image du projet" class="project-image">
            <p>Monte Carlo (MC) simulation in medical physics is extensively used during
                 research and development of nuclear imaging systems and treatment planning 
                 systems in radiotherapy. However, the increasing need for detailed and accurate 
                 simulations still leads to long simulation times. Variance Reduction Techniques (VRT) 
                 have been developed for years but are still restricted to specific applications. 
                 Fast GPU particle tracking methods have also been investigated but turned out to 
                 be difficult to maintain and generalize. Hence, there are still important needs 
                 to improve MC efficiency both in imaging and radiotherapy simulation.
                Recent developments on asymptotic VRT such as Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) and Artificial 
                Intelligence (AI) open new ways to improve MC. However, these methods are still 
                limited to some specific applications and do not revolutionize the basis of 
                MC simulation for medical physics. The ambition of the MoCaMed project is to design, 
                develop and evaluate advanced Monte Carlo sampling and Deep Learning methods to 
                improve MC simulations in medical physics.
